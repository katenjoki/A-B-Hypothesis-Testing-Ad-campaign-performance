<h2>A/B Hypothesis Testing: Ad campaign performance </h2>

<h3>Business objective</h3>  

An advertising company is running an online ad for a client with the intention of increasing brand awareness. The advertiser company earns money by charging the client based on user engagements with the ad it designed and serves via different platforms. To increase its market competitiveness, the advertising company provides a further service that quantifies the increase in brand awareness as a result of the ads it shows to online users. The main objective of this project is to test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness. 

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
SmartAd is a mobile first advertiser agency. It designs intuitive touch-enabled advertising. It provides brands with an automated advertising experience via machine learning and creative excellence. Their company is based on the principle of voluntary participation which is proven to increase brand engagement and memorability 10 x more than static alternatives. 
SmartAd provides an additional service called Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), a lightweight questionnaire, served with every campaign to determine the impact of the creative, the ad they design, on various upper funnel metrics, including memorability and brand sentiment. 
As a Machine learning engineer in SmartAd, one of your tasks is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
Hypothesis testing is the cornerstone of evidence based decision making. The A/B testing framework is the most used statistical framework for making gradual but important changes in every aspect of today’s business. Please read A Refresher on A/B Testing to get a rich business and historical context. 
Data
The BIO data for this project is a “Yes” and “No” response of online users to the following question

**Q: Do you know the brand Lux?
		O  Yes
		O  No**

This is a test run and the main objective is to validate the hypothesis algorithm you built. SmartAd ran this campaign from 3-10 July 2020. The users that were presented with the questionnaire above were chosen according to the following rule:
