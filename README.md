<h2>A/B Hypothesis Testing: Ad campaign performance </h2>

This repository contains code to solving an Ad-Campaign business problem, using A/B testing.

<h3>Business objective</h3>  

An advertising company is aiming at increasing its market competitiveness. In order to achieve this, the company provides a service that quantifies the increase in brand awareness as a result of the ads it shows to online users. ***The main objective of this project is to test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.*** 

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
To determine the impact of the ad they design, the ad company provides an additional service called Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), a lightweight questionnaire, served with every campaign.
One of the tasks is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.

<h3>Data</h3>
The BIO data for this project is a “Yes” and “No” response of online users to the following question

**Q: Do you know the brand Lux?
		O  Yes
		O  No**

This is a test run and the main objective is to validate the hypothesis algorithm built. The Ad co. ran this campaign from 3-10 July 2020. The users that were presented with the questionnaire above were chosen according to the following rule:

Control: users who have been shown a dummy ad
Exposed: users who have been shown a creative (ad) that was designed by SmartAd for the client.
